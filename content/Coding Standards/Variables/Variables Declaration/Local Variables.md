### Local Variables
- **Local variables** are declared within methods and are only accessible within their method scope. Use camelCase for naming local variables, and ensure names are descriptive enough to indicate their purpose:
  ```csharp
  var score = CalculateScore();  // 'score' is a local variable
  string playerName = "Hero";  // Explicitly declared local variable
  ```
