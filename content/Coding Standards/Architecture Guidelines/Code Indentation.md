# Code Indentation

Consistent code indentation is one of the simplest yet most important practices in game development. It doesn’t change how the code runs, but it greatly improves **readability**, **team collaboration**, and **maintainability**.

---

## Guidelines

- **Use tabs (enter key) instead of spaces** for indentation.  
  This ensures consistency across different editors and avoids mixed indentation issues.
- **Keep indentation consistent across the project** - every developer should follow the same style.
- **Nest code logically** to make structures easy to follow. For example, every new block inside an `if`, `for`, or `class` should be indented one level deeper.
- **Avoid overly deep nesting** - if indentation goes beyond 3–4 levels, consider refactoring into smaller methods.

## Why Indentation Matters
- Improves **readability** for you and your teammates.
- Prevents **merge conflicts** caused by inconsistent styles.
- Makes debugging faster by clearly showing code structure.
- Encourages **clean and professional code standards**.
