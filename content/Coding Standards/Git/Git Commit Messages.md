# Git Commit Messages
Commit messages are the **history of your project**.  
Writing good commit messages helps you and your team understand what happened and why changes were made.

---

### Rules for Good Commit Messages
### Be clear and concise
Describe what the commit does, not just the fact that something changed.
#### Good Example
`Fixed null reference exception in GameController`

#### Bad Example
`Fixed bug`

### Keep it short, but add details if necessary
- First line = short summary (max ~50 characters).
- Follow-up lines = explanation (what, why, how).

---

### Why It Matters
- Easier to track changes in Git history.
- Helps with debugging (finding where a bug was introduced).
- Improves collaboration between developers, artists, and designers.
