- What it is: Using print statements instead of proper debugging or profiling tools.
- Why itâ€™s bad: It floods your console, slows down your game, and hides real errors.
- Your console looks like the Matrix, and you ignore all the red errors.

**Better: Use the debugger, conditional logging, or the Unity profiler.**
