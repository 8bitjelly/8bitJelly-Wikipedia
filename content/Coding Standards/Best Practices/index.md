## Best Practices for Performance

- **Avoid unnecessary allocations** in frequently called methods to reduce memory pressure.
- **Use object pooling** where applicable, especially for objects that are frequently instantiated and destroyed.
- **Profile your code** regularly to identify and eliminate bottlenecks.
- **Optimize algorithms** for time complexity, especially in loops or recursive methods.
