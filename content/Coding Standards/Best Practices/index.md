# Unity C# Best Practices

Welcome to the **Best Practices** section of our Unity development guide.

Game development in Unity is powerful and flexible, but without consistent practices, projects can quickly become messy, inefficient, or difficult to maintain. This section is dedicated to highlighting **what to avoid** and **what to do instead** when working with Unity and C#.

You’ll find clear explanations of common pitfalls - such as overusing `GetComponent`, tight coupling, or relying too heavily on Singletons - and better approaches that lead to cleaner, safer, and more scalable code.

The goal here is not to overwhelm with theory, but to provide **practical, real-world advice** that keeps your project stable as it grows. By following these guidelines, your scripts will be easier to understand and your systems more reusable.

Adopting these practices will help you:
- **Avoid hidden performance traps**
- **Write code that is easier to maintain and extend**
- **Collaborate effectively without stepping on each other’s toes**
- **Build a solid foundation for future updates and features**
